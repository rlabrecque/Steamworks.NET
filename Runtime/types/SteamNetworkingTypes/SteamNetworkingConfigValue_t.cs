	/// when the options are applied.  To set options at creation time in a reliable way, they must be
	/// passed to the creation function.  This structure is used to pass those options.

	/// when the object is created, we just iterate over the list of options and call
	/// ISteamNetworkingUtils::SetConfigValueStruct, where the scope arguments are supplied by the
	/// object being created.
