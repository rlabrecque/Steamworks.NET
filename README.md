Steamworks.NET
=======

_Steamworks.NET_ is a C# Wrapper for Valve's Steamworks API, it is intended for use with Unity. This project relies on dynamic libraries created by [CSteamworks](https://github.com/rlabrecque/CSteamworks). (Prebuilt and included for ease of use)

_Steamworks.NET_ was designed to be as close as possible to the original C++ API, as such the documentation provided from Valve largely covers usage of _Steamworks.NET_. 
Niceties and C# Idioms can be easily implemented on top of _Steamworks.NET_.

The included CSteamworks.dll was built with VS2010, and as such requires [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555). You must also ship this to customers via Installation -> Installers on the Steam Partner Website.

_Steamworks.NET_ currently supports Steamworks SDK 1.28.

Usage
--------

To use _Steamworks.NET_ you must be a Steamworks developer. _Steamworks.NET_ Requires Unity Pro for the plugin functionality.

* Clone or download a Zip Archive: [Stable (1.1.0)](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/archive/1.1.0.zip) -- [Master (Cutting-edge Development)](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/archive/master.zip)
* Extract and copy Steamworks.NET's `Plugins/` and `Editor/` folders into your `Assets/` folder.
* Open `Plugins/Steamworks.NET/redist/steam_appid.txt` and replace `480` with your own AppId.
* Launch your Unity project. It should copy steam_appid.txt (and steam_api.dll if your on windows) into the root of your project.
* Close Unity and relaunch the project so that it loads the newly copied steam_appid.txt & steam_api.dll.

If you plan on shipping a Linux build (do it!) then you must edit `Plugins/Steamworks.NET/redist/linux/launchscript` and replace `REPLACEWITHYOURGAMENAME` with your games name.


If you wish to use the functions from `sdkencryptedappticket.dll` then you will need to manually place the dll/so/dylib in the following location:
* Windows: Next to steam_api.dll
* OSX: In `/Contents/Frameworks/MonoEmbedRuntime/osx/`
* Linux: Next to CSteamworks.so

`sdkencryptedappticket.dll` can be found in the Steamworks SDK.

Check out these sample projects to get started:
* [Steamworks.NET Example](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-Example)
* [Steamworks.NET Test](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-Test)


Limitations
-----------

* Only x86 builds are currently supported
* The Overlay and Steam Controller only work when launched from Steam directly.
* When used from within the Unity Editor, Steam will think you are in game constantly. This is normal and does not effect usage.
* _Steamworks.NET_ does not currently support ISteamAppTicket or ISteamGameCoordinator.
* The following Interfaces are largely untested (but should be completely functional):
```
ISteamMatchmaking (May require some work!)
ISteamNetworking
ISteamUGC
ISteamUnifiedMessages
ISteamGameServer
ISteamGameServerHttp
ISteamGameServerNetworking
ISteamGameServerStats
ISteamGameServerUtils
