# Steamworks.NET

_Steamworks.NET_ is a C# Wrapper for Valve's Steamworks API, it can be used either with Unity or your C# based Application.

_Steamworks.NET_ was designed to be as close as possible to the original C++ API, as such the documentation provided from Valve largely covers usage of _Steamworks.NET_.
Niceties and C# Idioms can be easily implemented on top of _Steamworks.NET_.

_Steamworks.NET_ currently fully supports Windows, OSX, and Linux in both 32 and 64bit varieties. Currently building against Steamworks SDK 1.52.
